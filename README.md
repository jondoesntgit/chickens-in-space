# Chickens in Space

As part of my honors thesis, I created an educational game to give students a chance to see how black holes form, and how gravitational waves from stellar collisions can affect objects. The game was tested in a high school and university setting.

The game is created using the Phaser.io framework. The game can be played on a browser such as Chrome by loading the index.html file.

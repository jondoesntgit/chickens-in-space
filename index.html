                Imagine if you had the super power to create chickens out of nothing? Or imagine if you had a magical chest that everytime you reached into it, there was a live chicken inside of it? Infinite food supply? Yes. Infinite supply of annoying clucking noises? Yes. But perhaps the best use of this super power is to overcome limitations of the rocket equation.

                You see, if you want to move at point c, you need to have fuel at point c to burn. In order to burn it at point c, you need to carry the fuel to point c from point b. This means that at point b, you needed to burn fuel to carry your ship an dyour fuel to point c. The more fuel you need at point c, the more fuel you need to burn at point b. But in order to burn fuel at point b, you needed to carry that fuel from point a. The more fuel you want to burn at point b, the more you needed to burn at point a to carry all that fuel over to point b. Confused yet? That's okay. Just remember, <b>the get thrust you want at a given location, you need exponentially larger amounts of thrust at earlier locations to move the fuel for subsequent accelerations.</b>

                This is because you need to conserve mass. But, if you had a magic box that created <strike>mass</strike> chickens, you could get around this limitation, and accelerate any way you jolly well please.

                <p>That is the fundamental concept of Chickens in Space. Keep in mind that chickens are not pleased to be in the 3K vacuum of space, and when they glob together due to gravity (as they eventually will) they will grow angry at you. If they collapse into a black hole, they will supernovae out <strike>radiation</strike> feathers and <strike>heavy metals</strike> eggs to get their chicken revenge!
